## Testing and Validation

Summarize the results of testing across different devices and screen sizes.  
Mention any issues found and how they were resolved.  
**Guidance:** Summarize the results of your testing across various devices using tools like Chrome DevTools, as outlined in Phase 2. Mention any issues found and how they were resolved.

#### Bugs and Fixes
One minor bug but now fixed was how the hero section background image was shrinking and sliding in an undesired manor as the scene got smaller. This was fixed by tweaking the background image in the CSS file, background: url("../images/heart-hands.jpg") no-repeat center; the no-repeat center was added.

Navigation bar was not expanding into the burger icon at the correct screen size. Initial set with the bootstrap class of navbar-expand-sm, this was changed to md instead thus creating a more responsive navbar.

### Validation
Discuss the validation process for HTML and CSS using W3C and Jigsaw validators.  
Include the results of the validation process.  
**Guidance:** Document your use of W3C and Jigsaw validators to ensure your HTML and CSS meet web standards. Include any errors or warnings encountered and how they were resolved.
